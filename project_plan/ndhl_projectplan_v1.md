expected benefit, i.e. the benefit intended to be achieved within the
customer's organisation, should be found in the project directive.\>

Project objective
-----------------

\<Summarise the result that should be achieved at a certain time, and
for which cost.

Describe also the balance in the project objective between the
result/time/cost dimensions. The basis for this should be found in the
project directive.\>
