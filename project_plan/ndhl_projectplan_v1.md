1: Objective
=========

1.1 Background and project idea
---------------------------
Because the humanities and arts are challenged by the technical requirement of the "digital revolution", development of e-Infrastructure has favored domain experts in the core humanities and arts areas (literature, history, media studies). It order to develop high impact research in Digital Humanities and Humanities Computing, it is also neccesary that expert users (researchers with rich code repositories and technical research profiles) get access to a *shared compute and data infrastructure that can facilitate code and data sharing for highly heterogeneous and unstructured cultural heritage data*. Nordic Digital Humanities Laboratory (NDHL) is an infrastruture initiative in the Nordic countries that with the goal of providing said infrastructure for expert users initially and, in time, for the rest of humanities and arts. This project plan describes the prestudy for NDHL.

1.2 Project objective
-----------------
For the prestudy NDHL has three objectives (in decreasing order of importance): *Infrastructure Design*, *Community Building*, *Funding Application(-s)*. 


*Infrastructure Design*, by autumn 2020 partnering countries should agree on a minimal software stack with shared libraries and applications for Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden and documentation for execution, storage and management layers for Denmark and Finland. This objective takes precedence over other objectives and all *Workshops* (see section 4) should explicitly state how they contribute to the objective.

*Community Building*, to facilitate successful infrastructure design and development, it is necessary to build a stronger community among expert users, data and e-infrastructure providers in the Nordic countries. Community building is considered a direct product of *Hack days* and indirect of *Workshops* (see section 4).

*Funding Application(-s)*, in order to develop and implement NDHL, the partnering countries (or a subset hereof) need to formulate a generic research infrastructure application ultimo 2020. The final workshop in December 2020 is dedicated to this objective. If the partners decide not to move forward with the infrastructure, this objective is cancelled. This decision should be an outcome of the final workshop.

\<Summarise the result that should be achieved at a certain time, and
for which cost. Describe also the balance in the project objective between the
result/time/cost dimensions. The basis for this should be found in the
project directive.\>

[comment]: # (table has ++dimensions, @Michaela: how do you want it populated?)

| Objective | Description | Priority |
| ----------|-------------|:--------:|
| Result    | | |
| Time      | | |
| Cost      | | |
            

Limitations
-----------

\<Clarify the project objective by describing what is not included in
the result, i.e. what other projects, the orderer or line functions are
responsible for, alternatively what will not be done at all.\>

Recipients and approval criteria
--------------------------------

\<Define for each delivery object who, or what organisation, will be the
recipient when the project delivers and transfers the result.\>

  Delivery object   Recipient, delivery   Recipient, transferral
  ----------------- --------------------- ------------------------



\<Describe also the approval criteria for the different delivery
objects. Use an appendix if needed.\>

Project schedule and costs
===========================

Milestones, decision points
---------------------------

\<Describe key check points in the form of milestones and decision
points. When required, a Gantt chart can be attached as an appendix. Use
the PPS templates: "Project schedule" in PowerPoint (see" the Project
plan, presentation template") and the "Schedule" in Excel.\>

Defined milestones (MS) and decision points (DP):

  Date   MS   DP   Description
  ------ ---- ---- -------------



Project cost estimate
---------------------

\<Specify the number of hours and the expenses required to execute the
project, preferably per work area.\>

  Work package/Calculation item   Hours   Cost
  ------------------------------- ------- ------


  Total

  Reference group   
  Working group     

Working methods
===============

\<If possible, always refer to documented working methods in the
organisation. Describe only exceptions or additions to those methods,
and also working methods that are specific for this project.\>

Requirement dialogue and change control
----------------------------------------

\< Describe how the stakeholders' expectations should be clarified, how
the requirement dialogue and the work involved in establishing support
will be carried out, and also how the project handles changes to the
requirements. Who decides what.\>

Delivery and transferral
------------------------

\<Describe the procedure for delivery and approval, and also for
transferral and approval. Appendices can be used for complex deliveries,
in order to clarify details regarding packaging, delivery procedure and
approval criteria (e.g. requirement and solutions descriptions).\>

Monitoring and learning
-----------------------

\<Describe how monitoring will be carried out, at what intervals, and
the forums that will be used. Describe the activities that the project
has planned for continuous learning and lessons learnt, and also how
this knowledge will be passed on to others.\>

Information distribution
-------------------------

\<Describe how the project information will be spread both internally
and externally.

Risks

\<Present the risks that have been identified during the preparation
phase. Present also the measures that will be taken. If the risk profile
is extensive, use the PPS template "Risk list".\>
